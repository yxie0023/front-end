      <h3>
          Each year, around 3000 people of refugee background settle in Australia. It is found that people of refugee background are at a risk of being under-immunized. Country of origin vaccination schedules are different to the Australian National Immunization Program (NIP) schedule, which means the chances of anyone arriving fully vaccinated is very low. Moreover, they arenâ€™t educated about what vaccines are available for them here in Australia. Even if they know about the vaccine, they are hesitant to take the vaccine jab because they are not aware of the positives of the vaccines leading to vaccine hesitancy.

          SuperProtector is a web application that will help in eliminating the cause of Vaccine Hesitation in a group of people, namely the refugee women and children and also help in educating these people of the positives and health benefits of the vaccination required to be taken by them.
