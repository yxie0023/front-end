      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <h3>SuperProtector is a website that will help in eliminating the cause of Vaccine Hesitation in a group of people, namely the migrants, refugee women and their children. Country of origin vaccination schedules are different to the Australian National Immunisation Program (NIP) schedule, which means the chances of anyone arriving fully vaccinated is very low. We provide a pathway for vaccine awareness, which can be availed by them.
