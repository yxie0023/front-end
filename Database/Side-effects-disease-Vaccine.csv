For every 10 children who develop measles encephalitis, 1 dies and 4 have permanent brain damage. About 1 in 100,000 develops SSPE (brain degeneration) which is always fatal.","About 1 in 10 has discomfort, local inflammation or fever. About 1 in 20 develops a rash which is non-infectious. Fewer than 1 in 1 million recipients may develop encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)."
Meningococcal ,Meningococcal infections Bacteria spread by respiratory droplets; causes septicaemia (infection of the blood stream) and meningitis (infection of the tissues  surrounding the brain).,"About 1 in 10 patients die. Of those that survive, 1 in 30 has severe skin scarring or loss of limbs, and 1 in 30 has severe brain damage.","Conjugate vaccine - About 1 in 10 has local inflammation, fever, irratibility, anorexia or headaches."

Occasionally, mumps causes infertility or deafness.",1 in 100 vaccine recipients may develop swelling of the salivary glands. 1 in 3 million recipients develops mild encephalitis.
Pertussis,Pertussis Contagious bacteria spread by respiratory droplets; causes whooping cough and vomiting lasting up to 3 months.,About 1 in 200 whooping cough patients under the age of 6 months dies from pneumonia or brain damage.,As for DTPa vaccine (see diptheria).
Pneumococcal,"Pneumococcal infections Bacteria spread by respiratory droplets; causes septacaemia, meningitis and occasionally other infections.",About 1 in 10 meningitis patients die.,Prevenar (<2 years) - about 1 in 10 has local reaction or fever. Pneumovax23 (>2 years) - about 1 in 2 has a local reaction.
Polio,"Polio Contagious virus spread by faeces and saliva; causes fever, headache and vomiting and may progress to paralysis.","While many infections cause no symptoms, about 1 in 20 hospitalised patients die and 1 in 2 patients who survive is permanently paralysed.","Local redness, pain and swelling at the site of injection are common. Up to 1 in 10 has fever, crying and decreased appetite."
Rotavirus,Rotavirus Virus spread by faecal-oral route; causes gastroenteritis which can be severe.,"In children less than 5 years of age, rotavirus infections in Australia account for approximately 10,000 hospitalisations every year, approximately 115,000 children visit a GP and approximately 22,000 children require an Emergency Department visit. Illness may range from mild, watery diarrhoea of limited duration to severe dehydrating diarrhoea and fever which can result in death.",1-3 in 100 vaccine recipients may develop diarrhoea or vomiting in the week following vaccine administration.
Rubella,"Rubella Contagious virus spread by droplets; causes fever, rash and swollen glands, but causes severe malformations in babies of infected pregnant women.","About 5 in 10 patients develop a rash and painful swollen glands; 5 in 10 adolescents and adults have painful joints; 1 in 3000 develops thrombocytopenia (bruising or bleeding); 1 in 6000 develops inflammation of the brain; 9 in 10 babies infected during the first 10 weeks after conception will have major congenital abnormality (including deafness, blindness or heart defects).","About 1 in 10 has discomfort, local inflammation or fever. About 1 in 20 has swollen glands, stiff neck or joint pains. About 1 in 20 has a rash which is non-infectious.

Infection during pregnancy can result in congenital malformations in the baby. Onset of infection in the mother from 5 days before to 2 days after delivery results in severe infection in the newborn baby in one-third of cases.",About 1 in 5 has local reaction or fever.
